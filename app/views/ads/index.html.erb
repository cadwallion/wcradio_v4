<p style="color: green;"><%= flash[:notice] %></p>
<p>We here at WoW Radio take the stance on gold-selling very seriously.  Goldselling advertisements are a tremendous problem in Google AdSense, and they are continously crafty in their ability to wiggle into AdSense unexpectedly.  However, Google AdSense is ripe with goldselling advertisements because it is an effective tool for getting revenue for a site like us to stay afloat.  As a result, we have made the decision to enter the fray of combat against these evil ads in order to continue bringing you, the listener, the World of Warcraft news and podcasts that you have come to enjoy, as well as more initiatives on the website and other projects in the future.</p>
<p>So, from now on you will see on the right-hand side a Google AdSense bar in place of the blank box you saw before.  The web team, as well as WoW Radio staffmembers, will be monitoring the ads to be vigilant in the blacklisting of any site that manages to worm their way into our adbox that is deemed unacceptable.  We, like many WoW Community sites out there, will regularly post our blacklist for any other World of Warcraft community site to use and review, should they choose to leverage the power of AdSense on their site as well.</p>
<p>What can you do to help, you ask?  Well, right below the AdSense block is a 'Report an ad' link that will take you to our advertisement reporting page.  Enter in as much information as possible about the ad being displayed that you would like to report (at minimum please provide the url of the ad) and our web team will blacklist the ad as quickly as possible.  This will ensure that you can contribute to the fight against goldsellers in AdSense and our continued existence on the Internets.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are interested in an advertising campaign here on WoW Radio, we are always happy to talk to you.  Contact eriyanna@wcradio.com for more information about pricing and options.</p>
