Listeners can expect to find extremely knowledgeable and professional show teams providing them with lively talk-radio entertainment, in-house produced features and a small selection of music during live shows. We hope to provide the very best in independently-produced WoW entertainment and information, while maintaining a firmly credible and reputable stance and not pulling any punches on our opinions, nor pandering to Blizzard Entertainment. We feel that this makes us an exceptional fansite.

WoW Radio is, as far as we are aware, the most prolific World of Warcraft-related site on the internet. We produce huge quantities of media, including videos, songs, editorials and of course, our hugely popular podcasts. We take pride in the regularity of our productions and their quality. We'd like people to always have something new to see and listen to whenever they visit our homepage.</p>

<p>Here's a little bit of history. WoW Radio began as one show, Saturday Nights with Athalus, on October 11th of 2004. The initial shows, airing during beta, were hugely popular and the station acquired a second host and show and began to grow into what it is today. WoW Radio has suffered numerous negative events over the past couple of years, but has survived and grown stronger as a result. In 2005 we were privileged to broadcast live from the Blizzcon in Anaheim, the only organisation to provide 'from-the-floor' live coverage at the event. The website during this time clocked in over 1 million hits. Station founder Athalus left the station on the 18th March 2006 after his final goodbye show. The station is now owned by TotalBiscuit who also hosted WoW Radio's flagship shows, [EPIC] and Blue Plz! which took over Athalus' spot on Saturday nights, as well as a series of hugely successful uber-guild interviews. WoW Radio has many new projects in the pipeline so stay tuned, there's a lot more where this came from.</p>
